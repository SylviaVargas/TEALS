# Python Lab 2.3 - Activity 4: For loops
### @explicitHints false

##  Intro @unplugged
In this tutorial we will learn and practice doing loops in Python.

## Step 1: Printing to the game console
### @flyoutOnly true
To print to the game console without a sprite, use the **game.splash** command.
Write a python command to splash "Welcome to Python Lab 2.4"

``` python

game.splash("Welcome to Python Lab 2.4!")

``` 

## STEP 2: For loop

In the Python editor, write a **for** loop from 1 to 10 which writes to the screen 1 to 10. You will be using the function [range](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp)

Run the project to see that it works.
Remember to click on the "A" button to advance to the next number.

``` python

for counter in range(10):
    game.splash(counter)

```
