### Tutorial: Python Loops

Loops are used in Python to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops in Python: `while` and `for` loops.

## While Loop
A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
```
Output:
```
Count is: 0
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
```

## For Loop
A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print("I love", fruit)
```
Output:
```
I love apple
I love banana
I love cherry
```
